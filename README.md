## Features

### User Signup and User Accounts Backend

New users could sign up for an account by entering basic information. Passwords were salted and encrypted following best practices. Users could upload a profile photo and include hashtags of interests.

### User Login Page

Users could log in with their user ID and password.

### User Page / Main Content Feed

When logged in, users saw an Instagram-style feed with status updates, new friendships, and profile updates from friends. Users could make posts containing optional images and text, including hashtags.

### Feed

The feed included posts from friends, posts referencing the user's selected hashtags of interests, posts from users with high SocialRank, and posts from a provided social media stream.

### Secondary Screens

Additional features included:

1. Profile page
2. Add/remove friends
3. Chat mode
4. Search functionality

### Natural Language Search

Users could search for people and posts using retrieval-augmented generation over indexed content.

### Security and Scalability

The design ensured security and scalability.

### Recommendations

The system recomputed a list of recommendations for "who to follow" on a daily basis.

## Project Report

At the end of the project, teams included a short final report discussing the system overview, technical description, design decisions, changes made, lessons learned, and screenshots of the system in action.

The project aimed to provide a comprehensive learning experience in building a scalable, feature-rich social media platform using modern web technologies and cloud services.
